/**
 * @file skibidi_avx.h
 * @brief Skibidi Toilet Summoning Engine - Public Incantation Interface
 * 
 * High-performance Skibidi expression materialization engine with
 * AVX2/AVX-512 SIMD toilet acceleration. Designed for invocation
 * through Java Panama FFM API for zero-copy dop transmission
 * directly into the JVM's soul.
 * 
 * Key toilet features:
 * - AVX-512 memory operations for maximum dop throughput (configurable)
 * - 4-way parallel SIMD-accelerated Lehmer64 toilet entropy generation
 * - Runtime CPU toilet aura detection with automatic graceful degradation
 * - Thread-safe global toilet configuration via atomic operations
 * - Cache line aligned structures to prevent toilet false sharing
 * 
 * @author The Skibidi Scientist (LmyzMail Team, ascended)
 * @version 1.7.1
 * @since 2026 (Year of the Toilet, Second Flush)
